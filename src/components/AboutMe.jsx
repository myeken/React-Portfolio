            I am a driven and curious person, recently graduated from Purdue University of Fort Wayne with a Bachelor's in Computer Science, and eager to bridge creativity and technology through software development. With a keen interest in designing innovative solutions, I focus on developing scalable web applications, optimizing user experiences, and exploring the exciting world of game development. My journey in coding has not only sharpened my technical skills in languages like Java, Python, and JavaScript, but it has also fostered a deep appreciation for teamwork and continuous learning. When Iâ€™m not coding, I enjoy diving into new technologies and expanding my knowledge to stay ahead in this ever-evolving field.
